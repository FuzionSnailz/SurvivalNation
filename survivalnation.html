            <h2>Welcome to SurvivalNation, Entertainment at it's Finest</h2>
            <p>SurvivalNation in short, is an Entertainment & Tech Company. To expand on this, we create and specialize in a couple of different areas. Some of these areas include
            video games, board games, TCG, movies, animation, comics, music, software, hardware, and networking. We plan to expand as much as we can to incorperate even more, and
            make the world a better, more positive place. This is a place where discipline, ideas, imagination, and dreams thrive.

            <h2>Why SurvivalNation</h2>
            <p>Have you ever had an idea for a game you wanted to play? Have you ever had an idea for a comic book character you wantes to see? In today's world, you can't really
            just go out and ask a studio or company to make that for you. You can rarely even get companies to take customer feedback and improve on what their customers actually
            want. Well, here at SurvivalNation, we want our community to be very involved and give them the opportunities to express their ideas while we assist in bringing them
            to life. We also want to give opportunities to those who like. This could be by voice acting, coding, designing, modeling, becoming an artist, and much more.
